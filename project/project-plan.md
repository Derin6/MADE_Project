# Project Plan

## Main Question
<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 5 sentences. -->

Is there a correlation between Education level and Economic Freedom and what features of each of them are the root of this. 

## Description
<!-- Outline the impact of the analysis, e.g. which pains it solves. -->

 Education quality and growing new generations that have a higher cognitive skill are considered as a one of the key features of the success of a country in term of economical computation and freedom in the world. By the help of these two datasets, we can compare their correlation to test the hypothesis and addition to that, we can analyze how this correlation is changed in time since our datasets are measured the performance on both categories for a considerably long period of time.
