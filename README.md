# Correlation between Human Development Index and Crime Rates in the World

## Overview
* The United Nations provides several datasets that are used in studies conducted to analyze the current situation of the world and identify trends. This helps in understanding where the world is headed.

* In this study, we are questioning whether there is a correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and crime rates (in two types of categories: Offenses or Environmental Crimes) at the country level.

* In the link below you can find the datapipeline which is used to load the data from the internet, proccesses it and stores it to a database:

##Context

*This repository contains my project from FAU's "Advanced Methods of Software Engineering" course, where I developed a Data Engineering Project. It involved using an automated pipeline to process data from two public sources and extract insights. In the exercise folder, you could access to the files regarding the exercises during the course.
